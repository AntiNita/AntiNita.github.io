As I played my favorite tunes, nearly everyone passed quickly.

I tried to raise the volume to attract more attention, but it was too noisy. So, I stopped the *Minuet in G Major* and turned to *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star*, then my tiny chronic harmonica won a crowd of young fans for its melody, in the center of a huge outpatient hall at a children's hospital. 

People seem to possess a genuine interest in music regardless of context, age, or gender. Preference might vary, but love prevails. By knowing the preference, I get a little closer to the listeners. I always introduce myself with harmonica as my hobby.

I received my first polyphonic harmonica in the third grade, and immediately I knew I love it. I was so engaged with this resin and metal instrument that expressed my feelings perfectly. Breath by breath, its punchy midrange sounds became my new voice, as I fumbled around to find the right note with my mouth. On the second day, with my background in piano as a cue, I managed to play some simple melodies. The joy of accomplishing something great sustained. An hour could pass very quickly with harmonica, and I was never tired of repeating the sections to achieve the sound on my mind. 

As I became more proficient with the C-major polyphonic harmonica, I found it harder to get the feasible tunes for practicing -- a lot of them are not in C major. I researched online and figured that with 64 notes recorded on only 16 holes like a miracle, the chronic harmonica was all I needed. I got one, and the journey of wonder began. 

The harmonica is not a popular choice of instrument, so I had to self-study. Luckily, I found some books and videos, and instead of "practicing" the harmonica, I played it for fun. With even more luck, it never fails me. Each time when I had the chance to perform, I chose the harmonica. I often received comments like "even this could be played?" It is an instrument of infinite possibilities. Violin or guitar, classical music or jazz music, performance or habit. These are all possible when I keep learning more and exploring more. After I became a math volunteer tutor online, a little piece of harmonica was the tiny reward to keep my pupils interested in challenging themselves. The melodies easily cured their anxiety in doing seemingly endless exercises. The young heart resonated to the happiness I delivered, and so did I.

I used to think that there is a "right" way to do everything, just as there used to be a "right" solution to the math questions in the exams. Harmonica broke that mindset easily with its flexibility and the nature of freedom in music. One day during another performance, I did not cooperate well with the piano performer, so I improvised some random chords until I could catch up. I was so nervous that I could nearly feel my pulses on the stage, but after the performance, everyone I interviewed thought it was what we had prepared. I felt relieved and realized that there was no "wrong" or "perfect" music. Instead, there are "better" or "worse" sounds that appeal to individuals. As I listened more, my intuition will guide me to a more beautiful place. I do not have to be identical to the script when I perform, because I am also a producer when I adapt the songs to myself. In doing so, I contribute to the diverse music territory with my own tastes and ideas. 

With the exploration, the harmonica has become a part of me, a wooden vocal organ that I carry around during vacations. It produces endless miracles with its intricate structures and my creativity. It renders happiness. It teaches me. It represents me. It is my most surprising encounter in music.
