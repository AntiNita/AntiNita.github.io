# IB Resources
## Introduction 
It was not until I found the notes from ibling that I recoganize the value of reading the others' notes, and creating my own. Hopefully this helps you as well. Will be updated until the final exam in May, 2019.

I'm a diploma student, and my courses are:

- HL: English A Lang & Lit; Economics; Math
- SL: Chinese A Lang & LIt; Environmental Science and Society; Chemistry

The subjects I score the highest are Economics and ESS, but I study chemistry collaboratively, which gives me a good amount of resources.

## English A HL
For this section, I will include the pdf of all the notes I made for paper 2, and potentially some other resources on paper 1. Sorry that my IOC prep are not available for sharing because I mostly did handwriting... Anyways, the books might be different. The most important part about this subject is to learn how to construct arguments -- at least, according to my experiences with my teacher.

## Extended Essay

For the extended essay, I choose English A category 1. For this section I might include my end product if the external assessment is B (or above, but I guess I would get a B at best). Otherwise, I will just share some of the tips I found useful...
