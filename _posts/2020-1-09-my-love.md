You are the cool jazz for me. 
<!--more-->
My surpressed happiness floats when we talk,   
just as how I feel the joy cool Jazz brought me   
every time I listen.   
I lose my mind.  

I read Sylvia Plath before I sleep,  
to clear that tensions on my foolish heart.  
Reading her is hard, and you are harder.  
I partly know your insecurities, and I can hardly know   
how you deal with them all the time.   

The illusionary world sinks each time you have to  
face the truth, but you stand up again and manage to  
mark your existence for more than 28 years.  
You are 10 years ahead of me.  
Mentally we are the same sex.  

You have girlfriends and partners;  
I have no experiences of any kind,   
and I am conservative on that.  
Sometimes I know we need to end this;  
things go wrong right from the beginning.  

I shouldn't hurt you in the future,  
and we are not a good fit, so it will end,    
and I won't know when.  
I shouldn't continue, but I can't give up.  
Maybe you are just too beautiful.  

I love you the way I love cool Jazz.  
This is unreal.  
This is real.  
You are perfect as imagination.  
So please just improvise.
