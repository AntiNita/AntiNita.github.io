## Personal Touch
Basically, cool jazz is all the reasons I want to learn how to improvise, with a harmonica. I think it makes me happy, so I want to produce more happiness myself as well. 
### Intention
Cool jazz is the dim light in the complete darkness after a day's bright sunlight. It lights up the happiness, but not too much, just enough to make me feel "life is so nice".
