For me,   
you are like the cool Jazz.  
<!--more-->
My surpressed happiness floats when we talk,   
just as how I feel the joy cool Jazz brought me   
the first time I listened.   

I have to read Sylvia Plath every night before I sleep,  
just to clear that tensions on my foolish heart.  
Plath is really hard for me to understand, and you are harder.  
I partly know your insecurities, and I can hardly know   
how you deal with them all the time.   

The illusionary world sinks each time you have to  
face the truth, but you stand up again and manage to  
mark your existence for more than 28 years.  
You are 10 years ahead of me.  
Mentally we are the same sex.  

You have a girlfriend and a bunch of partners.  
I have no experiences of any kind you want,  
and I am conservative.  
Sometimes I know we need to end this;  
things go wrong right from the beginning.  

I should not hurt you in the future,  
and we are not a good fit, so maybe I will,  
and I won't know when.  
I don't want to, but I can't give up.  
Maybe you are just too beautiful.  

I love you like I love cool Jazz.  
This is unreal.  
This is real.  
You are perfect as imagination.  
So just improvise.
