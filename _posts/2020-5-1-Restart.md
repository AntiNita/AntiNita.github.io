## A little bit of update
So finally, I've finished my high school and have a little bit too much time as a holiday ALL AT HOME due to the pandemic. I don't really have the courage to travel around... and in fact there's a way too much books to read. 

Even though I do want to create a new website, it's not all set yet so I will use this website first as the personal story and stuff while the other to be more technical. Sounds like a plan. 

Should I write in English? Or should I write in Chinese? Or even both languages?? Well, it's kinda hard to decide. So, if you find it really frustrating to see another language which you don't understand quite well, I'm sorry, I'm just too lazy to translate it myself. Go ahead and use the google translator, it's not that terrible now.

## So, what am I doing?
Reading books, learning (or pretending to learn) mathematics, trying to get a driving licesense, trying to use emacs for latex more, trying to get ready for the future while constantly relax myself, basically.

## What will I post, exactly?
Since I'm to some extent fond of reading, I will try to make this site show the artistic side of myself... more... hopefully... 

Anything related to alcohol/literature/music/arts in general :)

## What are my other sites?
I'm building another site with the link yxiao-qwq.github.io, and maybe another which I will introduce in another post some time in the future about a collaborative learning reflection of me and my best friend at HS (hello future viewers, since I'm too lazy to update the existed post once and for all, it might be finished when you actually read this article, idk.) 

Thanks for reading, feel free to message me with the email anne.yx01@gmail.com
