## Brief Introduction
Sopor Aeternus & The Ensemble of Shadows is a band with currently only one member, Anna-Varney Cantodea from German. Anna is one of the most mysterious figure in music, because we have never actually seen her face -- I guess Sia sort of adapt this idea from her. She's a transgender women i.e MtF, and her music does include themes about transgender and the other taboo topics (to some degree). This gives her works a prevailing sense of despair and pain. Undoubtedly, though, they are beautiful.

Anna's music falls within the genre "other". She's just too unique to be tagged under any existed popular categorization. Later I realized that music should not be categorized -- the classification is just a means for the companies to "sell" the music, because it's always easier for the audiences to anticipate the music by their tags than by their names. 

So if I have to anticipate what I get from Anna's music, I would not be able to do so: her voice is like no other, and her music is the work of wonder. Ideally I would like to explore the combination of classical music and electric pulses, and she's just more than that simple integration. 

## Recommendations 
I selected "Cage within a Cage" here because it touches me the most. Her music is difficult to interpret, and I guess she deliberately did so. This is the only piece that I manage to decode after translating the German captions into Chinese. I would say this is about her transgender identity, and about the fact that we need a meaning for life while there isn't any.
