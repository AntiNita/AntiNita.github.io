I laugh more than before. I said I don't enjoy talking like that and I didn't apologize. I guess that's confusing, as you asked me why I didn't tell you. I was just afraid, and I'm sorry for that.

Love is hard for me in any sense. I want to make a definition, but I can never. My mom tried to define one for me, and she failed. So I don't know. and I don't want to know -- there shouldn't be a definition. 

Some people said that love is love. Even more said that love is illusionary, so better to be careful than to be fool around. To be "mature", to be "realistic", to be "wise", you have to believe that love is about money and sex instead of emotions, and emotions don't matter for "adults" because they are short-live. 

I'm not mature enough, too idealistic, "young dumb and broke".

I don't believe them. Emotions shape us all, and they change from time to time.

I'm 18, and oftenly I still follow my mom's advice. You are at the age that I never dare to talk about your parents, because I know that they aren't great. In fact, there are a couple things I don't really dare talking about. I don't really have the courage to say, to name, or to ask. I'm not couragous at all when I talk to you. 

You do want me to understand how you feel everyday, which Anna-Varney Cantodea explained in the other way. I was so shocked when I listened *Cage within a Cage* for the first time, and I guess that's what you tried to say. Cage within a cage, reality is just there. The deepest fear, the ultimate anger, the hopelessness -- I don't know if I can get along with them well. If I don't, I fear the consequences.

I tend to think more than I should. I tend to talk less than I could. You ask and ask, and I wait for the end. I know I'm horrible, so I don't step forward.

I no longer read any love stories. I listen to tons of love songs, and I hope you are in each one. However, only Anna can describe with the highest precision. I want to finish all her works, but it's too painful. Like what I feel when I depict the next steps: I will leave in a few months, just enough for a break up with my first lover. 

I'm fear of facing my real desires, which I hide all that time that I nearly forget.
