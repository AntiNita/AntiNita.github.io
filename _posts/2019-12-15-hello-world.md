Welcome aboard, someone behind the screen! 

<!--more-->

Finally I succeeded without learning much about programming/web development (I played around with git a few days though). Thanks to this helpful [step-by-step guide ](https://tianqi.name/jekyll-TeXt-theme/docs/en/quick-start)with all sorts of resources needed!

 Also, it's one of the templates that can be regarded as aesthetically appealing. 

Super excited to post more articles, photos, and even music if possible. 

When it comes to computers and internet, every projects start with "Hello, World." I believe there's some strength in it.

I haven't decided what to post yet because I always have a way too many things on my mind, especially when I'm super busy, like now. Creating a site is definitely a great way to organize my thoughts, and I would really love to communicate!
