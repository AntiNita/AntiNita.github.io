## Why "Antinita"?
Well, Anita & Nita was taken, and antinita was a username of an email I created in middle school by mistake, and it kinda fits my tastes. 

*I just can't explain. *

## Why Little Anne?
My English teacher, an Ireland man traveling all the time during his break said that this is the Spanish meaning of "Anita".

## Why creating this site?
As I grow up, everything starts to fade away, like how I fade away from my memories and hometown. It's the age of internet, so I try to find that corner that I can always reserve for myself. Hopefully, these binary codes can stay with me as long as possible. Keep up the good work, Microsoft, plz.

## So... what's the plan?
Although I have stressed in the "Hello, World" cliche opening article that I DON'T HAVE A PLAN, there is one in fact -- sharing my interests, and motivating myself, and hopefully the others, to find and share their interests. Writing is a good way of organizing thoughts and knowledges, which turns all the inputs into process and output (BTW I'm quoting the system diagram in ESS), so I feel keeping an old-fashioned blogs that the 80s and 90s do will make me a better person as a stimuli (quoting English A Written Task).
