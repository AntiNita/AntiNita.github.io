## Introduction 
It was not until I found the notes from ibling that I recoganize the value of reading the others' notes, and creating my own. Hopefully this helps you as well. Will be updated until the final exam in May, 2019.

I'm a diploma student, and my courses are:

- HL: English A Lang & Lit; Economics; Math
- SL: Chinese A Lang & LIt; Environmental Science and Society; Chemistry

The subjects I score the highest are Economics and ESS, but I study chemistry collaboratively, which gives me a good amount of resources.
